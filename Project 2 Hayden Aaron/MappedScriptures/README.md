Suggestions for User Experience:
- Cut out any middle views that aren't useful. For instance, when you click on "Introduction" skip to "Introduction" instead of having a middle view. (I worked on trying to fix this for a while but was unsuccessful)
- Change "D&C" to "Sections" in the Book browser view
- Also change "Chapter" to "Section" in Doctrine and Covenants chapter list browser view
- Change "Official Declaration" to "Official Declarations"
- For a generic map with no points show the center of the map and not Jerusalem cordinates. Expand the map to view the whole world. (I had enough time to improve this)

Scripture Shared:
- I shared Alma 31:5 with my father. I explained how I honestly could be better with reading my scriptures, and how I know that if I read more scriptures more dilligently than I will have more power. I will have the Spirit and I will be able to better follow the Savior Jesus Christ.

Principles Learned:
- I learned so much doing this assignment. I learned about how to integrate a database into my app and write query code that would allow me to collect data such as volumes and books. I also learned the importance of having a good architecture for your app an architecture that is stable and allows little opportunities for possible bugs. I also learned how to do a popover for the image tags. I also learned how to pass view models better through views, however, if I could redo my app I would try using the environment architecture to build a better experience. In addtion, I learned how to better create a viewmodel and use "@Published" variables. I understood it before, but I feel I solidfied my understanding with this application.

Other Excellent Extras:
- I inclued a popover for each pin for individual location it will display that location to the user with an image of that location. I was not able to find plus 1000 images for all possible locations, but I have a generic image if a location does not have an image. However, I downloaded around 30 images. If you go to "Joshua 6" you will have a good example of what I have done. In "Joshua 6" all of the images have will show up. I will note that the popovers do not work super will in the tablet because the popover is not properly anchored to each pin. I did not have enough time to improve this. However the images still popup, but are just not anchored correctly in the map view.
