Learning Experience for HW 11:

I learned a lot of valuable principles while doing HW 11. First, I learned how to read and write to the file system. I learned how to use FileManager to perform those read and writes. I learned how that might be a really good option especially if you have really large amounts of data that you would want to persist. I also learned the importance of breaking up code to be more efficient. For instance, the urlForFile code could be used both for reading and writing the json data. This was a helpful learning experience to dive deeper into how an app can work with a file system and store valuable app data there.
