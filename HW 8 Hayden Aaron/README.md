Learning Experience:

I learned a lot of good things during this assignment. First of all, I solidfied my understanding of the MVVM framework by creating the delete function. The delete function passed through all of the layers of the framework in order to delete an emoji. I feel like I am starting to get a good grasp on creating intents in a view model and how they are useful in maintaining the integrity of the data in the model. In addition, I learned more about tap gestures. I was able to create a tap gesture that deletes emojis with a triple click. I also learned about scaling and using the right amount to scaling to properly scale each emoji and save that size using the scaling method that you created. It wasn't easy, but I am starting to understand how the scaling works and was able to further implement this project.
